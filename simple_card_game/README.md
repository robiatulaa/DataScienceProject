# Simple Card Game

This is a simple text-based card game built with Python.  
The game runs in the terminal and allows the player to interact through a menu.

## How it works
- When you start the program, you will see a menu with several options:
  1. Start the game  
  2. Pick cards  
  3. Shuffle the deck  
  4. Show your cards  
  5. Check the result (only if you already have six cards)  
  6. Exit the game  

- The game ends when you either choose the exit option or check the final result.

## Features
